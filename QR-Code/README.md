### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Min,Max Width and Height

### What I learned

I got to practiced the flexbox in this also the new thing i learned is giving a container 100% width while also giving it max-width whatever we want. This hekped me in making it responsive.

```css
main{
  width: 100%;
    max-width: 450px;
}
```


### Continued development

I want to focus more on responsive layouts and making more websites using JS too.I want to work more on my flexbox and grid layouts also on responsive width and heights.
